      <p>A flexible approach to your travel dates can greatly enhance your chances of finding cheaper flights. Airfare prices can change significantly during peak seasons.

        alt="Activate Price Alerts">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Take advantage of fare alerts provided by travel websites and mobile applications. With this feature, you are informed when there’s a decrease in prices for your desired route. Registers for alerts from airlines, Google Flights, or travel aggregators will keep you updated on the best deals.</p>

      <h2>Use Private Browsing</h2>

        height="360" 
        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Use Private Browsing">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Airlines commonly track user searches, affecting ticket prices based on data collected from your previous searches. To prevent this issue, search for flights in private browsing mode or ensure your cookies are cleared before your query. This tactic might expose you to lower fares.</p>

        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Investigate Nearby Airports">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Widen your search beyond one airport. Look into nearby airports that are easy to reach. These locations might offer more competitive flight prices, resulting in substantial savings.</p>

      <h2>Book at the Right Time</h2>

      <!-- Lazy Loaded Image with Fallback -->
      <!-- <amp-img

        width="640" 
        height="360" 
        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Book at the Right Time">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>The timing of your flight booking plays a vital role in determining the final fare. Aim to purchase tickets several weeks before your scheduled departure, as prices tend to rise as the date approaches. However, avoid booking too early; finding a time frame of about 1-3 months before your trip is optimal.</p>
