        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Create a Reward System">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Establishing a reward system can motivate you to complete tasks. Set up small rewards for yourself upon completing a task or a series of tasks. This could be anything from taking a short walk, enjoying a snack, or indulging in some leisure activity. The anticipation of a reward can help you stay focused and reduce the temptation to procrastinate.</p>

        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Practice Mindfulness and Self-Compassion">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Developing mindfulness can enhance your awareness of procrastination patterns and encourage you to tackle them. Practicing self-compassion is equally important; avoid harsh self-criticism and remind yourself that everyone procrastinates. Acknowledging your feelings without judgment can help reduce anxiety and foster a healthier approach to productivity.</p>
