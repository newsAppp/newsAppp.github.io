      <p>Your credit score is calculated based on several key factors: 1. Payment History (35%): Timely payments boost your score, while late payments can significantly lower it. 2. Credit Utilization (30%): This ratio indicates how much of your available credit you are using. Keeping it below 30% is ideal. 3. Length of Credit History (15%): A long, positive credit history is advantageous. 4. Types of Credit (10%): A mix of credit accounts (credit cards, mortgages, etc.) can positively affect your score. 5. New Credit Inquiries (10%): Frequent applications for credit can lower your score temporarily.</p>
