      <p>On-Page SEO refers to the practices you implement directly on your website to enhance its position in search rankings. This includes optimizing content, HTML tags, images, and overall user experience. Techniques such as keyword research, meta descriptions, and internal linking are essential components of On-Page SEO that ensure search engines can easily crawl and index your site effectively.</p>

      <h2>What is Off-Page SEO?</h2>

      <!-- Lazy Loaded Image with Fallback -->
      <!-- <amp-img

        layout="responsive" 
        alt="What is Off-Page SEO?">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Off-Page SEO entails all the activities you engage in outside of your own website to improve its search ranking. This primarily involves link building, social media engagement, and influencer marketing. Off-Page SEO aims to establish your site's credibility, authority, and relevance in your niche, and it can significantly affect how search engines perceive your content.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences Between On-Page and Off-Page SEO:</h2>

      <!-- Lazy Loaded Image with Fallback -->
      <!-- <amp-img

        alt="Key Differences Between On-Page and Off-Page SEO:">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>The main difference lies in where the optimization takes place. On-Page SEO is concerned with factors you can control and manage on your own site, while Off-Page SEO involves strategies that may require external input and relationship-building efforts. Additionally, On-Page SEO is primarily about providing quality content and a smooth user experience, whereas Off-Page SEO focuses on generating backlinks and building your site's reputation.</p>
