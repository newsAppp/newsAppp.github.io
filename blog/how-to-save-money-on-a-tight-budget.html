      <p>Take a hard look at your spending habits and identify unnecessary expenses. This could include subscription services you rarely use, dining out less frequently, or avoiding impulse purchases. Make a conscious effort to distinguish between needs and wants, and eliminate or reduce the latter whenever possible.</p>

        alt="Shop Smart">

        alt="Cook at Home">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Eating out can quickly drain your budget. Prepare meals at home, which not only saves money but is typically healthier as well. Plan your meals for the week, make a shopping list based on those meals, and stick to it to avoid impulse grocery purchases.</p>

        layout="responsive" 
        alt="Automate Savings">
      </amp-img> -->

      <p>Set up an automatic savings plan where a certain amount of your paycheck is transferred to a savings account. This way, you save money before you even have a chance to spend it. Treat your savings like a fixed expense to ensure you consistently set money aside.</p>
