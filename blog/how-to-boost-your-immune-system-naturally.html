      <p>The food you consume plays a critical role in supporting your immune system. Focus on incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your meals. Foods rich in vitamins C and D, zinc, and antioxidants can especially help bolster your immune response.

      <p>Proper hydration is vital for overall health and helps your body function optimally. Water assists in flushing out toxins and helps in the production of lymph, which carries immune cells throughout your body. Aim to drink at least 8 cups of water a day, and more if you're physically active.</p>
